# IPFS storage

[IPFS ](https://ipfs.io/)is the inter-planetary file system. Both [colossus](https://app.gitbook.com/@hut34/s/wiki/~/drafts/-Lvbx-YJvYmqFR6fVZ9t/products/colossus) and [hutX](https://app.gitbook.com/@hut34/s/wiki/knowledgebase/hutx) use IPFS as the default storage option

It is a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) and [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network for storing and sharing data in a [distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system). IPFS uses [content-addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) to uniquely identify each file in a [global namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Namespace) connecting all computing devices.

IPFS allows users to not only receive but host content, in a similar manner to [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent). As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Any user in the network can serve a file by its content address, and other peers in the network can find and request that content from any node who has it using a [distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) \(DHT\).
