# Secure

Secure feature allows datahut users to easily and rapidly secure and store their valuable data using distributed web technology - specifically the [interplanetary file system](https://ipfs.io/) \(IPFS\).

Using IPFS, your data is stored with persistance and, most importantly, you maintain control of your data.

Secure is powered by our [colossus](https://docs.hut34.io/wiki/products/colossus) tool and world first [hut34 wallet](https://docs.hut34.io/wiki/products/h34-wallet) technology.
