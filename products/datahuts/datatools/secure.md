# Secure

Our Colossus microservice and smart contract suite manages data security and storage,  forming the foundation for secure and trustless data exchange using the hutX protocol.

Using our Secure feature, call the colossus microservice, allowing datahut users to easily and rapidly secure and store their valuable data using distributed web technology - specifically the [interplanetary file system](https://ipfs.io/) \(IPFS\).

Data is stored with persistance, and most importantly only the user maintains control of their data through the world first [hut34 wallet](https://docs.hut34.io/wiki/products/h34-wallet) technology.
