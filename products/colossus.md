# colossus

The Colossus microservice and smart contract suite manages data security and storage,  forming the foundation for secure and trustless data exchange using the hutX protocol.

Colossus, as configured allows datahut users to easily and rapidly secure and store their valuable data using distributed web technology - specifically the interplanetary file system \(IPFS\).

Data is stored with persistance, and most importantly only the user maintains control of the data.
