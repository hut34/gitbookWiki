# Hut34 ecosystem overview

Hut34 data tools power agile data practices, bringing together the power of emergent technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, DLT and Blockchain into an easy to use toolkit where teams can unlock more value from their data and achieve higher levels of security and output.

The foundation unit of all Hut34 activity is the [hutX](https://app.gitbook.com/@hut34/s/wiki/~/drafts/-Lv9WYxnZ6fEzO-e8yvl/knowledgebase/hutx) smart data object.
