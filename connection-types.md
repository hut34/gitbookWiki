### Send a message to the Hut and get a response

Sending your question to Hut34 and getting responses is simple. To send your question you need to post a JSON to your Hut34. You can use following Payload class.

```javascript
    public class Payload {
      public string message { get; set; }
    }
```

You will need to post your JSON to the following url by replacing \[DEVICE\_KEY\] with the key that you found from the previous step.

> [https://platform.hut34.io/botquery?platform=msft&key=\[DEVICE\_KEY\]](https://platform.hut34.io/botquery?platform=msft&key=[DEVICE_KEY])

Here is the the complete code in C\#:

```csharp
var client = new WebClient();
        client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType] = "application/json";
        var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new Payload { message = "what is day today." });
        string response = client.UploadString("https://platform.hut34.io/botquery?platform=msft&key=[Device_Key]", json);
```

Your query will be processed by the platform. Hut34's response will be sent back to you in the following JSON format.

```javascript
    {
        {
        "id": "b224cad-7337-448b-82dd-5ce6d77a755",
        "timestamp": "17-11-2017 11:35:42",
        "message": "response from hut34",
        "response": {
            "source": "source of response",
            "resolvedQuery": "original query",
            "isComplete": true
        },
        "input": {
            "source": "calling bot",
            "Key": "35686e7518v74dabnvbbd9224acd8d"
        },
        "status": {
            "code": 2,
            "type": "success"
        },
        "error": {
            "code": 1,
            "description": ""
        }
    }
```

### Replying to questions sent by Hut34

To reply questions sent by Hut34, you will need to create a webhook that listens to questions posted by the platform and send back a reply. Hut34 will post the following JSON to your webhook:

```javascript
  {
    "message": "Insert your query here."
  }
```

You can get questions from message attribute and send response back by responding with the same JSON after populating your answer in the message attribute. You can use the Payload class \(provided above\) to process the JSON if you want. Webhooks can be created in different ways by extending the WebHookHandler class and overriding the ExecuteAsync method. You can also write a custom method code to handle post requests in Global.asax class.
