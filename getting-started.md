# Getting Started

## Overview

This page will walk through the most important features of the Hut34 Platform and show you how to connect your device or agent using our existing integrations. The methods for connection are [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/),  [AllThingsTalk](https://www.allthingstalk.com/), [MS Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and generic webhooks.

## Create an account

Sign up to the alpha platform [here](https://platform.hut34.io/Account/Register). Access to the alpha release is limited and requires approval. Once approved you will receive an email to verify your email address.

## Register your first device 

Once you are logged in, it will direct you to the platform dashboard where you can find information for all your devices and bots.

To get started, click on the "register a device" option at the top of the page or click [here](https://platform.hut34.io/Registration/Create). You will have to complete the following:

* Device Name - an identifier for the device \(e.g 'Health Bot'\);
* Invocation - a reserved keyword for direct routing to your device \(e.g. health\_bot\);
* Fee - this is the fee your device will collect each time it responds to a query;
* Location - a label used when routing is specific to a region or location
* Meta-tags - a set of labels, separated by commas that are used by our routing engine;
* Connection Type - generic webhook, [AllThingsTalk](https://www.allthingstalk.com/), [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) and [MS Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

Further documentation about connection types can be found on the next section.
